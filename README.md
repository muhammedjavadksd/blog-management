**Project Description: User Blog Management Platform**

This Blog Management Platform project showcases a comprehensive solution that allows users to create, manage, update, and delete their own blog posts. The platform includes a user-friendly experience where users can sign up, log in, and manage their blog content securely. Each blog post consists of essential elements, such as a title, image, and detailed content. 

The project emphasizes security and efficiency, with features like:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization** - Only authenticated users can perform actions on their own posts, with JWT ensuring secure access.

2. **CRUD Operations for Posts** - Users can create, view, edit, and delete their posts via robust API endpoints, with validation to maintain data quality.

3. **Image Uploading Capability** - The system supports image uploads, securely storing and associating each image with the relevant post in the database.

4. **Database Management** - Using PostgreSQL or MongoDB, the system maintains user accounts and blog details, with a well-designed schema for efficient data handling.

This project demonstrates a strong grasp of backend development skills, database management, and secure API design, providing a practical, real-world application of these skills in a full-featured platform
